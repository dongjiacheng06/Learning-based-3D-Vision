# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve this list of learning-based 3D vision papers. You are welcome to open PRs, file issues, or contact me directly.

## Ways to contribute
- Add new papers or surveys
- Fix links, typos, or metadata
- Propose new categories when necessary

## Add a paper
1. Find the best category in `README.md`.
2. Insert the entry in chronological order (YYYY.MM ascending) within that category.
3. Keep the formatting consistent with nearby items.

Recommended format:
```md
- **ShortName**, "Full Paper Title". [arXiv 2024.01](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx)
```

Optional code link:
```md
- **ShortName**, "Full Paper Title". [CVPR 2024](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/) [code](https://github.com/org/repo)
```

If a paper is a must-read, prefix the item with the same "Recommended" marker shown in the README Legend.

## Add or update categories
- Please avoid changing existing categories unless there is a strong reason; prefer adding papers to current sections.
- Add a new header in `README.md` for the new category.
- Add a placeholder line if the section is empty.
- Update the table of contents to include the new section.

## Propose changes via issues
If you do not want to open a PR, create an issue with:
- Paper title and short name

- Suggested category and date
- Brief note on why it fits

## PR checklist
- One topic per PR
- No duplicate entries
- Links open correctly
- Formatting matches existing sections
